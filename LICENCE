Notes:
	I attempted to make my code as free for you to use as possible. This licence is meant to give you the upmost
	freedom to do whatever you want to do with my code. I do not require crediting as long as you don't take credit
	for making what I have made (SEE LICENCES BELOW FOR DETAILS).

	HOWEVER, the olc::PixelGameEngine is copyrighted to Javid9x 
	so if you are planning to fork my code and use his PixelGameEngine
	you must include his licence (SHOWN IN LICENECS BELOW).
