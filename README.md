Once you see this screen, you will notice that there is white stars. Those represent un-collected stars.
All icons that you see on the screen do something other than the paintings and the coin icon so please play around
and see what all of the buttons do :)

If you scroll down to the bottom you can see all of the sub menus that contain options to set game flags and castle secret stars

You can see this in the image below

### Saving / Loading files
If you wish to save your changes, hit "Save" button located in the top left corner of the main menu.

Once you are done it will show the flollowing screen
![save](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34013705/137811862-14d54782-6564-4cb5-9a26-13df8dcc6064.png)

From this menu you can select what format you need the save file to be in.

## TIP / HINT:
You can add/subtract coins from a level faster if you hold down the "Ctrl" (aka. "Control") key to make it faster.
Holding down Ctrl also makes you scroll down faster


## Installing
### Windows
Get a .exe from [the releases page](https://github.com/sonich2401/SM64_Save_File_Converter/releases) and run it.
It will prompt you to choose a location to install the program.
It will create a folder with a new .exe which will open the program

### Linux
The program has minimal dependancies and doesn't require you to be running a specific desktop enviroment as long as you have X11 and OpenGL.
You can get a pre-built binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/sonich2401/SM64_Save_File_Converter/releases).

If it doesn't run then compile from source and use
```
make
```
while in the same directory.

If building from source doesn't work, then you are out of options because wine will not help you.
Contact me in the issues tab if building from source doesn't work

## WARNING FOR LINUX USERS
DO NOT USE any version below version 1.0 of this program. Older demo builds will erase your save!!!!
As of version 1.0 it is 100% safe to edit your save files
